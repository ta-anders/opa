UI:
    - Fix up menu bar thing - probably just make it fixed.
    - Sort by volume/width/height.
    - Make drag and drop better - shouldn't be allowed to put on top of other
    objects. Potentially also should 'snap' to sensible location.
    - Make solve model where you can choose algo and set parameters etc.

Backend:

Solvers:
    - Fix up shared code and figure out best way to hook up solvers.
