UI:
    - Sort by volume/width/height.
    - Make drag and drop better - shouldn't be allowed to put on top of other
    objects. Potentially also should 'snap' to sensible location.
    - Make solve model where you can choose algo and set parameters etc.
    - Info section up the top, some description of features, links back to page
    - 'Auto place mode' - things get placed greedily when you drag in.
    - Figure out what is going on when you launch a new scenario after coming
    from another one - seems to load the other first?

Backend:

Solvers:
    - Fix up shared code and figure out best way to hook up solvers.
