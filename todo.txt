UI:
    - Sort by volume/width/height.
    - Make drag and drop better - shouldn't be allowed to put on top of other
    objects. Potentially also should 'snap' to sensible location.
    - Make solve model where you can choose algo and set parameters etc.
    - Info section up the top, some description of features, links back to page

Backend:

Solvers:
    - Fix up shared code and figure out best way to hook up solvers.
    - Little mini solve to figure out how to place one object (greedily).
    THen when you click an object it fires one off to display (somehow)
    to the ui where it would be placed, click to do so.
